					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>I found it Challenge setting up the imageses so that they would be side by side.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>problems that came up were images not appearing or setting up images side by side. but i was able to solve this by editing the 
						code so that it picked the images from my img folder and for the images to be side by side i pretty much got rid of the paragraph 
						code so that they would be Put in the same row. 
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I found this assignment to be much easier then the previous once becuase most of the work was already done or i would have already done 
						it without even realizing it.
